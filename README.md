i wrote this site in plain html with a classless css lib, [Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx) because it's pretty fun to do old school web.

it's hosted for free on a free tier aws ec2 instance, and automatically updates with a simple pull from github. when everything is massive and expensive, it's nice to have simple and lightweight tech. ahah rails makes me crazy i think
